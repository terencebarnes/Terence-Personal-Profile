        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p> When the pandemic happened, I was going down a rabbit hole of careers. Nothing seemed like it was the right fit. I didn't have the experience to get the job that I wanted nor the patience. </p>
	<p>You see, I come from a performance background. You have to consistently prove that you can efficiently perform at a high level. I felt as though I was wasting my life away working a job in the field where experience matters more than performance. </p>
	<p>There's a quote from my former head coach <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Bowles">Todd Bowles</a>. <em>"Rookies have to prove that they can do it and Vets have to prove they still got it!!"</em></p>
        <p> I kept asking for a sign to leave my job and a coding boot camp popped up on my feed. I haven't thought about coding since high school so I thought it was weird. I saw 17 different ads about coding and different people talking about coding on my timeline across my social media. I did my research afterward and knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.</p>
